You can now import Markdown table code directly using **File/Paste table data...** dialog.

### How to use it?

1. Using the *Table* menu set the desired size of the table.
2. Enter the table data into the table:
- select and copy (Ctrl+C) a table from the spreadsheet (e.g. Google Docs, LibreOffice Calc, webpage) and paste it into our editor -- click a cell and press Ctrl+V
- or just **double click any cell** to start editing it's contents -- Tab and Arrow keys can be used to navigate table cells
3. Adjust text alignment and table borders using the options from the menu and using the toolbar buttons -- formatting is applied to all the selected cells.
4. Click "Generate" button to see the generated table -- select it and copy to your document.

### Markdown tables support

As the official [Markdown documentation](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax "Markdown syntax documentation") states, Markdown does not provide any special syntax for tables. Instead it uses HTML <table> syntax. But there exist Markdown syntax extensions which provide additional syntax for creating simple tables.

One of the most popular is [Markdown Here](http://markdown-here.com/ "Markdow here") â€” an extension for popular browsers which allows you to easily prepare good-looking e-mails using Markdown syntax.

Similar table syntax is used in the *Github Flavored Markdown*, in short GFM tables.

### Example

GFM Markdown table syntax is quite simple. It does not allow row or cell spanning as well as putting multi-line text in a cell. The first row is always the header followed by an extra line with dashes "-" and optional colons ":" for forcing column alignment.

```
| Tables   |      Are      |  Cool |
|----------|:-------------:|------:|
| col 1 is |  left-aligned | $1600 |
| col 2 is |    centered   |   $12 |
| col 3 is | right-aligned |    $1 |
    
```
