After having [imported the repository with the SDK](https://mcuoneclipse.com/2023/08/13/vs-code-mcuxpresso-sdk-repository/), it is now time to create a first project.

Blinky Example in VS Code with the SDK

We have previously imported the SDK repository with the examples. Here we are going to create a new project from the examples in the repository.

From the extension, click on â€˜**Import Example from Repository**â€˜:

Import Example from Repository

Next, you can configure what you want to import:

Import Example settings

Press â€˜Createâ€™ and it creates a project. The project then shows up under â€˜Projectsâ€™ with extra information:

Project details

All the source files are visible with the Explorer view, which is usually used in VS Code to inspect the files:

Explorer in VS Code

There are following folders inside the project:

- **\_\_repo\_\_** conains files from the repository from where we copied the example, notably the device specific files, startup code and device drivers.
- **.vscode** is a standard VS Code folder which contains configuration .json files
- **armgcc** contains the CMake build files

Beside the source files in the top folder, there is a .mex file for the graphical configuration utility to set pin muxing and the like. The `.xml` file is used as a description of the project created.

There is currently no way to create a â€˜new/emptyâ€™ project. An example is a good starting point, and I will cover to create a project from scratch in a later article.

With this, we have a project we can build and debug, which is a topic for yet another article.

Happy importing ðŸ™‚
